[a]@jackie.plein@ridecircuit.com I like this new format, much easier to read and sort through. 


Important to remember that we need Spanish versions of all copy too.
_Assigned to Jacqueline Plein_
[b]Roger that... do we have any sort of resource for translating copy to spanish... either on the team or others who could assist?
[c]You probably don't want me doing it lol
[d]No human resources at the moment, we've had a mix of internal spanish speakers help out over the years but Google Translate has also been heavily involved. 


There is some Spanish copy in the original copy spreadsheet but we'll likely need to rebuild with new Spanish language resources.
